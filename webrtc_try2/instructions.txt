*Spring Boot All-In-One Demo*

This project demonstrates a single Spring Boot application that functions as:

1. An HTTPS REST API Server.
2. A WebSocket Server.
3. A Static File Web Server.

*Important: Generating the SSL Certificate*

Because this application is configured to run on HTTPS (server.ssl.enabled=true in application.properties), you must generate a self-signed certificate before running the app.

Open your terminal, navigate to the project root, and run this command:

keytool -genkeypair -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore src/main/resources/keystore.p12 -validity 3650 -storepass changeit


Note: If you do not have keytool installed, it is part of the standard Java Development Kit (JDK).


*How to Run*

1. Build the project:

  mvn clean install

2. Run the application:

  mvn spring-boot:run


3. Access the application:
  Open your browser and navigate to:
    https://localhost:8443

  Note: Since the certificate is self-signed, your browser will warn you about "Potential Security Risk". You must accept/proceed through the warning to see the page.
